## Hi there 👋

<h2>Amin Ghaffari</h2>

I’m a Bioengineering PhD candidate at the University of California, Riverside, where my research lies at the intersection of medical imaging, neuroimaging, and machine learning.

My work focuses on developing data-driven and computational methods for analyzing brain imaging data, particularly functional MRI (fMRI) and functional connectivity, with the goal of identifying robust, interpretable biomarkers of brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders. I am especially interested in connectome-based predictive modeling, dynamic functional connectivity, and individualized brain signatures for early detection and phenotyping across aging-related conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and physical frailty.

More broadly, my research involves medical image analysis, signal processing, and machine learning applied to high-dimensional biomedical data, with an emphasis on model interpretability, robustness, and reproducibility. I am also interested in advancing computational pipelines for multimodal imaging integration, longitudinal analysis, and personalized prediction models that can translate to clinical and real-world settings.
