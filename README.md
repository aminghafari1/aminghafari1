## Hi there 👋

<h2>Amin Ghaffari</h2>

I am a Bioengineering PhD candidate at the University of California, Riverside, working in medical imaging, neuroimaging, and machine learning. My research focuses on data-driven analysis of brain imaging data, particularly fMRI and functional connectivity, to develop interpretable biomarkers of brain aging, neurodegenerative disease, and physical frailty.

In parallel, I have experience in medical device–related engineering problems, including finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), with an interest in applying these tools to translational and real-world biomedical applications.

More information about my research and projects is available on my personal website:
